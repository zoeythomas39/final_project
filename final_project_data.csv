He played himself
Didn't need me to give him hell
He could be cool or cruel to you and me
Knew we'd put up with anything

I want to hurt him
I want to give him pain
I'm a roman candle
My head is full of flames

I'm hallucinating, hallucinating
I hear you cry
Your tears are cheap
Wet hot red swollen cheeks
Fall asleep

She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
And she locked the car and slipped past into rhythmic quietude
Lights burning, voice dry and hoarse
I threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
The chimes fell over each other, I fell onto my knees
The sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
A sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
Now I'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around

[Refrain]
I don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
It'll make a whisper out of you

[Verse 2]
She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
The fairground's lit, a drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through
Got his hat tipped bottle back in between his teeth
Looks like he's buried in the sand at the beach
I can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
To take a little nap while the road is straight
I wish that car had never been discovered
They took away the bottle and the hat he was under

Swept all aside

Other people's ambitions
I saw you waiting

Saint-like, with your warning

Said, ""Do what you have to do""

Mouthpiece to cheek

Dirty, stepped-on, lying out on the floor of their room
Faces fell long in the half-light

Look at him smiling full of teeth clenched tight

He knew the one time with the army captain
He got over that whole deal before it happened
And it's okay, I knew exactly what you meant
When you said you were an accident
When it's 3 AM, he wonders where in the hell she went

Like old cigarettes and pine
In her bag I saw things
She drew when she was nine

Her alone, nobody near

No, it doesn't look like you
But you did wear cowboy boots
That's your fame
There's no question about it

Last call, he was sick of it all
Asleep at home
Told you off
And goodbye

Well, you know one day it'll come to haunt you
That you didn't tell him quite the truth
You're a crisis, you're an icicle
You're a tongue-less talker, you don't care what you say
You're a jaywalker and you just
Just walk away, and that's all you do
The clap of the fading-out sound of your shoes
Made him wonder who he thought that he knew

[Chorus]
Last call, he was sick of it all
The endless stream of reminders
Made him so sick of you, sick of you, sick of you
Sick of your sound, sick of you coming around

[Verse 2]
Trying to crawl under my skin
When I already shed my best defense
It comes out all around that you won
And I think I'm all done, you can switch me off safely
While I'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me
Yeah, yeah
You're still here but just check to make sure
All you aspired to do was endure
You can't ask for more, ask for more
Knowing you'll never get that which you ask for
So you cast your shadow everywhere like the man in the moon

Want a violent girl who's not scared of anything

The pressure of days, do what I say
And I'll make you okay and drive them away

Don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will

Where I'm seeing you there, with your hands in the air

You're going to get wet

I can't prepare for death any more than I already have
All you can do now is watch the shells
The game looks easy, that's why it sells
Frustrated fireworks inside your head
Are going to stand and deliver talk instead
The method acting that pays my bills
Keeps the fat man feeding in Beverly Hills
I got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenity
And I get my check from the trash treasury
Because I took my own insides out

It don't matter because I have no sex life
All I want to do now is inject my ex-wife
I've seen the movie

144,Shiva Opens Her Arms,Grand Mal: Studio Rarities,"June 28, 2005",2006,"I'm so sick of people asking me, ""Have I seen this guy that I look like""
When they mean that he looks like me
Aw, damn it all to hell, no, I wouldn't know him too well
Except I broke into his home and then I broke his collarbone
His curtains hadn't been opened in a week or two
And the one picture that that little corn-dog freaker has of you
Looks like it's about to fall over, sure, yeah, it could just be the frame
Or it could be the fact that nothing in this house is ever on the level
Not even the toilet, both of you, it's all askew, it'll be wrong forever

I dreamt up we're tumbling down a hill
The people standing around swear they never seen blows fall like this
Wherever he lands, stay away, it's going to be bloody
Oh no, I miss you so

Church bells, now I'm awake and I guess it must be some kind of holiday
Go tell them that he better behave, it's pretty hard to rise from the grave
I'm just a ghost from the past, yeah, but you shouldn't have laughed
Because I'll give you the shaft or maybe I'll sign you up for the draft
I look down, I ripped my shirt and there's blood stains on my fists
And the air in here is like a nylon net, I can throw my fists right through it
Man, did anybody ever tell you that you're kind of like
A moth trying to catch the attention of a bare light bulb?

All recorded history is just one little guy on this mat
Oh, my head feels like a TV store, twenty of the same channels
Let's step outside for some fresh air
To some part of the city that you never seen yet
Even though you lived here all your life
You're not even sure who you've met or what you like
But you'll wait until morning, let's hold it now
And if that's the case you'll spend the night anyhow",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,https://genius.com/Elliott-smith-shiva-opens-her-arms-lyrics
145,I'm Gonna Get Crushed,Grand Mal: Studio Rarities,No date available,No date available,"It's just my sense of smell that made me wind up here where I don't belong
Oh, can't you tell what my intentions are, what I'm so stuck on?
When I'm chewing off a hangnail looking at your bike
And I had to nip a lot of seats, babe, before I knew what yours was like

Huh, I know it's pretty weird
And I may be too weird for you
And I may be too weird for you
And I feel like I'm gonna get crushed
Because I'm amorous

I picked it up from betting on the greyhounds
All pumped up from chasing something that they'll never catch around
But it's plain to see I couldn't possibly just be in the neighborhood accidentally
And Acapulco's gold, so high on my disease
I got a nosebleed living in my head

And I feel like I'm gonna get crushed
And I feel like I'm gonna get crushed
And I feel like I'm gonna get crushed
Because I'm amorous

And I feel like I'm gonna get crushed
And I feel like I'm gonna get crushed

To walk the stair steps in pairs
Climbing up a slippery slope
I'm in love, love I hope
Don't go home Angelina
Stay with me, hanging around in the lost and found
Kissed you quick feeling weird
Lonely lived and disappointed
This is such a simple place
Passing time can't erase
Don't go home Angelina
Paint tomorrow blue
Day breaks and every morning
When he wakes he thinks of you
I'm alone, that's okay
I don't mind most of the time
I don't feel afraid to die
She was here passing by
Don't go home Angelina

Always trying to get me alone
An easy way to lose it all
Always there when all else fails
Over by the west side rails

But I don't really need that now
I never really did anyhow
I only really needed alcohol
Something that'll treat me okay
And wouldn't say the things you'd say

Please turn out the light
I get a sick confusion headache trying to figure out who's right

Dreaming on the silver strand
Waking up to plainclothes man
You little bastard, little boy in blue
Someone's gonna get to you
And fuck up everything you do

He's so unhappy inside
He's serious with everyone
And he thinks he'll win you with his angry kiss
Acting like he has no needs
Wanting you to watch him bleed",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,https://genius.com/Elliott-smith-plainclothes-man-lyrics

I love my room yeah I really do
I can just come right in and sit right down
And open my window and see the town
I love my room yeah I hope you like it too
I love to open the shutters wide in the summertime

[Verse 1]
I only dream when she comes out at night
I only sleep in a tent just to never feel right
But in my mind due rest takes a lot of time
They try to keep us on a tether
They think that we came to watch the leather
All I ever wanted was plurality
But all I ever get is company
I love my room

[Chorus]
I love my room yeah I really do
Sometimes I'll smoke a cigarette
But be careful so the ash don't collect in my room
I love my room yeah I hope you like it too
I love to, in the darkness, hide after closing time

[Verse 2]
I was gonna tell you but I lost my senses
I forgot my grammar I was so tenseless
There was this beautiful story now it all comes back to me
Everybody walked in I'm packing
Everyone was necklace together
I pulled the fire alarm yeah

I've seen you watching
Her every time she crosses the floor
So won't you just go and talk to
The one you really adore

I'm getting pretty used to being
The one that you always ignore
When somebody wants you
I've seen it before

You're every kind of collar
There ain't nothing that you won't claim
Your ambition and promise
And your addiction to fame

And everyone's got a dollar
Sign after their name
When somebody wants you
You treat 'em just the same

So go on and pick up
You don't care what poison you choose
And what person you lose
It should've been me, yeah
Shouldn't it be?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,https://genius.com/Elliott-smith-i-figured-you-out-lyrics
